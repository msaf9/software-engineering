<h1> Prototyping Model </h1>

## Introduction

<p>Prototyping is a generic way of creating a functional replica of any idea, software, or system requiring more engineering to produce the final result. The prototype model will provide a miniature replica of your desired end product, requiring accurate consumer feedback to be crafted accordingly. A prototype of an application often demonstrates the usability of any product in the development phase, although it may not contain the exact requirements of the desired outcome. This article discusses the Prototyping model, one of the most prominent SDLC models.</p>
