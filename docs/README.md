## Introduction

## Topics

### Software Engineering

#### What is software engineering?

<p> Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users. </p>

### Models

1. [Waterfall Model](WATERFALLMODEL.md)
2. [V-Model](VMODEL.md)
3. Iterative (and Incremental) Model
4. Prototyping Model
5. [Spiral Model](SPIRALMODEL.md)
6. [Agile Methodology Development Models](AGILEMETHODOLOGYDEVELOPMENT.md)
   1. [Scrum Model](SCRUMMODEL.md)
   2. [Kanban Model](KANBAN.md)

### Software Management

<p>Project Management Software is software used by a wide range of industries for project planning, resource allocation and scheduling. It enables project managers as well as entire teams to control their budget, quality management and all documentation exchanged throughout a project. This software also serves as a platform for facilitating collaboration among project stakeholders.</p>

### Software Metrics

<p>A software metric is a measure of software characteristics that are quantifiable or countable. Software metrics are important for many reasons, including measuring software performance, planning work items, measuring productivity, and many other uses.</p>

[Examples of Software Metrics](SOFTWAREMETRICS.md)

### Project Planning

<p>A Software Project is the complete methodology of programming advancement from requirement gathering to testing and support, completed by the execution procedures, in a specified period to achieve intended software product.</p>

Read more about [Planning](PROJECTPLANNING.md)

### Risk Management

<p>Software development is activity that uses a variety of technological advancements and requires high levels of knowledge. Because of these and other factors, every software development project contains elements of uncertainty. This is known as project risk. The success of a software development project depends quite heavily on the amount of risk that corresponds to each project activity. As a project manager, it’s not enough to merely be aware of the risks. To achieve a successful outcome, project leadership must identify, assess, prioritize, and manage all of the major risks.</p>

### Software Requirement

<p>Software requirements for a system are the description of what the system should do, the service or services that it provides and the constraints on its operation. The IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology defines a requirement as:</p>

1. A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective.
2. A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document.
3. A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 or 2.

<p>The activities related to working with software requirements can broadly be broken down into elicitation, analysis, specification, and management.</p>

<p>Note that the wording Software requirements is additionally used in software release notes to explain, which depending software packages are required for a certain software to be built/installed/used.</p>

### Software Configuration

<p>As you’re no doubt aware, in software engineering, software configuration management (SCM) refers to a process for maintaining computer systems, servers, and software in a desired, consistent state.</p>

### Software Quality

<p>Software quality is defined as a field of study and practice that describes the desirable attributes of software products. There are two main approaches to software quality: defect management and quality attributes.</p>

Read more about [Software Quality](SOFTWAREQUALITY.md).

### Software Design

<p>Software design is the process of envisioning and defining software solutions to one or more sets of problems. One of the main components of software design is the software requirements analysis (SRA).</p>

### Coding

<p>Coding is a subset of programming.</p>

Know more about [Coding](CODING.md)?

### Software Reliability

<p>Software Reliability is the probability of failure-free software operation for a specified period of time in a specified environment.</p>
