<h1> Spiral Model </h1>

## Introduction

<p>The spiral model is a combination of sequential and prototype models. This model is best used for large projects which involve continuous enhancements. There are specific activities that are done in one iteration (spiral) where the output is a small prototype of the large software. The same activities are then repeated for all the spirals until the entire software is built.</p>
